        <h2>Sports</h2>

        <p>
            Sports are a blast. Whether it's listening to sports 
            radio and podcasts, or playing with my 8 year old 
            daughter, it always been a large part of my life. 
            Watching her learn and grow in her own way is the 
            best part. Sports, unless professionally, aren't
            tyically about the winning; it's about the experience 
            and learning important life lessons along the way.

        <h2>Traveling</h2>
        <img class="images" src="traveling.jpeg" alt="Traveling" />
        <p>
            Traveling, learning new languages, and understanding
            different cultures has always interested me. After 7
            years of Spanish, visiting other countries, and
            my stint in the melting pot that is the United States Army,
            that interest has written itself in my DNA. If someone
            never ventures out of their own comfort zone culturally,
            they miss out on the people they could meet, and never fully
            understand the world we live in outside of the myopic walls.

        <h2>Learning</h2>

        <p>
            Having a thirst for knowledge has guided me throughout my
            life. My daughter now has developed a similar way of being.
            We spend our time reading, questioning, and never settling for
            letting information come to us. We search for it in an 
            attempt to build out our mental storage units. If only I was
            as smart as she will be!
